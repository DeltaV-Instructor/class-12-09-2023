//global variables for grabbing html elements and we are going to set up some arrays to help us hold some values for the logic we need to render random images to the user..



//create a constructor function that will create pizza objects that holds data about our pizzas and the clicking info. {pizza info in these objects.}




/**
 * need to create a function to handle what happens when we click on the pizza
  add a check to see if we are clicking on a image
  add to our total clicks to finish rounds
  update the pizza object information times shown... both images each time - views
  count what image was clicked  - clicks
  logic -
  display our random images we are going random number from our pizza objects array
  we can then update the "src" in the html to update the image that we are seeing on the page
  add some logic for images that we just used array to store so we dont select those images again for the next round.
  lastly I want to count total clicks if statement when reach the end of 5 clicks 
  remove the event listener so the user can not click any more.

//create a function handleResult list showing ul and li on the left side of the page




//Eventually add the chart here form canvas.js big concept not much to code.


//add our event listeners for our button clicks  = 'click' events functions
//call the constructor function to create out pizza objects
